This repository includes code for extracting top 50 restaurant and bar lists for Phildelphia over several years, taken from Foobooz.  Each restaurant and bar is associated with a rank for each year, and is classified by location, cuisine and pricing features.

The goal is to use machine learning techniques to make predictions for future rankings and to determine whether there are any substructures to the data.
